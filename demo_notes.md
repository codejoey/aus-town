# solutions:
1. use new a16z-infra (new repo) with CLERK REMOVED, and see if that works - fast test (1hr)
2. pay pinecone or find code that doesn't use namespaces to try get-convex (old repo) working - fast test (15mins)
3. debug/log clerk issues in new a16z-infra (new repo) - debug challenge 
4. take convex implementation of new code and replace old get-convex repo with it (the pinecode aspect) - porting challenge

10pm Max will check msg
